## What is simplevm?
`simplevm` is a CHIP-8 like project. As the name says, it is a very simple turing-complete interpreter of its own opcodes. The code is documented, so, if you have a lot of free time, you can write a program for `simplevm` ( but do not do it now. There is a lot features to be added to make it even a little bit useful ).
