# simplevm
## What is simplevm?
`simplevm` is a CHIP-8 like project. As the name says, it is a very simple turing-complete interpreter of its own opcodes. The code is documented, so, if you have a lot of free time, you can write a program for `simplevm` ( but do not do it now. There is a lot features to be added to make it even a little bit useful ).
## How to build it?
Just compile it with `gcc main.c -o main`
## How to use it?
You must provide name of the target file with `-n [filename]` or `--name [filename]`
## How to write code for this VM?
I am too lazy to write a documentation for this project right now, maybe in the future
